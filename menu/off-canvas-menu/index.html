        “God sees everything,” repeated Wilson. “That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from
        the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding
        into the twilight. By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was
        one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and
        the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later
        and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.” Excerpt From: F. Scott Fitzgerald. “The Great Gatsby.” iBooks.
